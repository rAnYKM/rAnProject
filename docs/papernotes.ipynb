    "- **generative model**: a model for randomly generating observable data values, typically given some hidden parameters.\n",
    "- **stochastic block model (SBM)**: to divide $N$ nodes into $B$ blocks with $e_{rs}$ edges between nodes of blocks $r$ and $s$. The detection of modules involves inferring the most likely model parameter to generate the observed network.\n",
    "- **modularity**: to measure the strength of division of a network into modules (groups, clusters or communities). Hight modularity -> Dense connections within modules but sparse connections in different modules.\n",
    "- **assortative connection**: a bias in favor of connections between network nodes with similar characteristics. (in social networks, assortative mixing is known as homophily)\n",
    "- **core-periphery structure**: it consists of a dense cohesive core and a sparse, loosely connected periphery.\n",

    "In social networks, vertices can be divided into *communities* or *modules* based on their connections. The task of detecting modules in networks can be viewed as a process of statistical inference of the parameters of the generative model given the observed data. "
